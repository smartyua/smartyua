# Hi, I'm Grygorii Kylypko

Being an aerospace engineer by education, I always worked in software development, electronic engineering, and businesses around information technologies.

I know everything about nothing :)

🔎 I’m looking to collaborate on commercial projects and startups

❤️ I prefer React (P-Series) on frontend and MongoDB/PostgreSQL on backend

💬 Feel free to ask me about everything

🏆 Fun fact: I'm back to engineering after 15 years of business career 😉
